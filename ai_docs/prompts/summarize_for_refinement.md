read ${ai_docs/specs/overview.md}.
I want you to create a summary of the more nitty implementation "Project Details" similar to what we have in ${ai_docs/specs/overview.md}.

The summary must be roughly of the same length of ${ai_docs/specs/overview.md}. So don't go too much in detail. Just the overall situation of how the folder structure is and where things tend to be located.

read @src/review_clusterer/ file structure, check out @src/review_clusterer/cli.py for all the possible commands of this tool, dig deeper into any file that could be relevant in order to create the summary.
